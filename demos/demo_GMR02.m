function demo_GMR02
% GMR computed with precision matrices instead of covariances
% 
% Writing code takes time. Polishing it and making it available to others takes longer! 
% If some parts of the code were useful for your research of for a better understanding 
% of the algorithms, please reward the authors by citing the related publications, 
% and consider making your own research available in this way.
