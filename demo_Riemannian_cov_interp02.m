function demo_Riemannian_cov_interp02
% Covariance interpolation on Riemannian manifold from a GMM with augmented covariances
%
% Writing code takes time. Polishing it and making it available to others takes longer! 
% If some parts of the code were useful for your research of for a better understanding 
% of the algorithms, please cite the related publications.
