function [model, GAMMA2, LL] = EM_GMM(Data, model)
% Training of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
%
% Writing code takes time. Polishing it and making it available to others takes longer! 
% If some parts of the code were useful for your research of for a better understanding 
% of the algorithms, please reward the authors by citing the related publications, 
% and consider making your own research available in this way.
